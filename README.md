# Diamonds Project

## Overview
This project is an analysis and visualization of the `diamonds` dataset, which contains information about various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, price, and more. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data analysis, and create visualizations to uncover insights about diamonds. The project is divided into the following phases:
1. **Data Curation**: Understanding and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Analysis and Visualization**: Creating visualizations and performing statistical analysis to derive insights.
4. **Final Report**: Summarizing the findings and presenting actionable conclusions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the `diamonds` dataset, which is from 'Kaggle'. It contains 53,940 rows and 10 variables:

- **carat**: Weight of the diamond
- **cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **color**: Diamond color (D (best) to J (worst))
- **clarity**: A measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- **depth**: Total depth percentage
- **table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
- **price**: Price in US dollars 
- **x**: Length in mm 
- **y**: Width in mm 
- **z**: Depth in mm

## Analysis and Results
The analysis for this project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which is shared via Google Colab for easy access. You can view the notebook link in the `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.docx` document.  
   - The EDA document contains detailed insights, visualizations, and initial findings.

2. **Final Report**:  
   - The final report (`Final_Report.docx`) summarizes the analysis, key findings, and conclusions.
   - It includes advanced statistical analysis, visualizations, and recommendations based on the dataset.
