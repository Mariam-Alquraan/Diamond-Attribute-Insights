# Diamonds Project

## Overview
This project is an analysis and visualization of the `diamonds` dataset, which contains information about various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, price, and more. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data analysis, and create visualizations to uncover insights about diamonds.
